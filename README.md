This website is just a protype for my big project "Cleaning Fairy", which is a big e-commerce website.<br>
This was made just to practice django framework.<br>
This website has used django framework as backend and HTML, CSS and javascript for frontend.<br>
This website has a home page and fully functional contact form which can be used to store the details of the consumers and store it.<br>
The functionality of django which offered us the admin page also helps us to easily fetch the details of the costumers by the super user.<br>
This website has more features which is being under development.<br>
